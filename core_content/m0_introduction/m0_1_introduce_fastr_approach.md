# What is FASTR?

**Frequent Assessments and Health System Tools for Resilience**

A data-driven framework developed by the GFF to help countries monitor and improve maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health services.

---

## FASTR Supports Countries To:

- **Assess data quality** at national and sub-national levels
- **Track service utilization changes** in priority RMNCAH-N services
- **Monitor coverage progress** against country-specific targets

---

## Why Rapid-Cycle Analytics?

**The challenge:**
- HMIS data may not be analyzed promptly
- Data quality concerns limit trust and use
- Household surveys are infrequent (every 3-5 years)

**The solution:**
Rapid-cycle analytic approaches provide timely, rigorous data that respond to each country's priorities
