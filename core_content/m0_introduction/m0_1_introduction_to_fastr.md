## Introduction to FASTR

The Global Financing Facility (GFF) supports country-led efforts to improve the timely use of data for decision-making, ultimately leading to stronger primary healthcare (PHC) systems and better reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH-N) outcomes.

This set of initiatives and technical support is referred to as **Frequent Assessments and Health System Tools for Resilience (FASTR)**.

FASTR encompasses four technical approaches:
1. RMNCAH-N service use monitoring using routine HMIS data
2. Rapid-cycle health facility phone surveys
3. High-frequency household phone surveys
4. Follow-on analyses.
