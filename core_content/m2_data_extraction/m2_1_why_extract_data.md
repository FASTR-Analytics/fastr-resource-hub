## Why extract data from DHIS2?

### Data quality adjustment

The FASTR approach focuses on data quality adjustments to expand the analyses countries can do with DHIS2 data and to generate more robust estimates.

The FASTR methodology includes specific approaches to:
- Identify and adjust for outliers
- Adjust for incomplete reporting
- Apply consistent data quality metrics

These adjustments require processing that cannot be done within DHIS2's native analytics.
