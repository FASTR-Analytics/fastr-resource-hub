## Moving from data to key messages

### What is a result?
Results are what the analysis found (data quality scores, coverage estimations, service utilization numbers). They are often many in number, complex, hard to understand 'at a glance', and lacking interpretation.

### What is a key takeaway?
Key takeaways are what the results are telling us — why the results matter, the 'so what'. They should be few in number, simple and clear, easy to remember, and actionable.
