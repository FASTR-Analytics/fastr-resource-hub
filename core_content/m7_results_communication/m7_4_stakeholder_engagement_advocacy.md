## End user mapping

End user mapping helps ensure that our outputs will meet the real needs of our end users.

### Key questions
1. **Who is my end user?**
2. **What does this end user need to accomplish with the report?**
3. **What information are they most interested in?**
4. **What do they like/not like about current reports?**
5. **How do they like to receive their information?**
