# Identify Questions & Indicators

This module guides the process of identifying the right questions and indicators for FASTR implementation.

## Overview

*Full documentation content to be developed*

This section will cover the complete process of:

1. **Introduction to FASTR: Gaps and Challenges** - Identifying gaps and challenges that FASTR is well suited to support, how FASTR serves as an entry point to reduce fragmentation, and starting the conversation with government stakeholders

2. **Development of a Data Use Case** - Co-creation workshop approach with MoH and stakeholders, data use case development guidance, and example use cases from country implementations

3. **Defining Priority Questions and Selecting Indicators** - How to define priority questions for FASTR analysis, criteria for selecting indicators, what makes a good FASTR indicator, and aligning indicators with national strategies

4. **Preparing for Data Extraction** - Pre-extraction checklist, understanding your DHIS2 configuration, mapping indicators to data elements, and planning your extraction timeline
